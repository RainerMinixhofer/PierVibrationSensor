# PierVibrationSensor
Software and Hardware Info Repository for Vibration Sensor to monitor the pier of my private observatory
The sensor system consists of an MEMS 9-axis motion tracker module the [MPU-9250/6500](https://github.com/NelisW/myOpenHab/blob/master/docs/707-MPU-9250-9265%20IMU.md) and two [LGT-4.5 horizontal Geophones](http://longetequ.com/geophone/3.htm) amplified with an [AD620 instrument amplifier](https://protosupplies.com/product/ad620-instrumentation-amplifier-module/) and converted to digital with the [ADS1256 24bit ADC](https://github.com/Arda-Bildik/ADS1256_library)
